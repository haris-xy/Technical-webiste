            Introduction
          </header>  
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

            So, what is HTML?
          </header>  
            <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Images">
          <header>
            Images
          </header>  
            <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the <code>src</code> (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.
    <br><br>      
              We have also included an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
    <br><br>
          <ul>
    <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
    <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your <code>src</code> attribute to make it incorrect.</li>
          </ul></p>
    <br>
        <p>
          The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The <code>alt</code> text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>

            Marking up text
          </header>  
            <p>This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
    <p>
    Headings
    <br><br>
    Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most.</p>
          <p>Paragraphs
    <br><br>
            As explained above, <code>p</code> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content.
    <br><br>
    Add your sample text (you should have it from What should your website look like?) into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your element. </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Links">
          <header>
            Links
          </header>  
            <p> Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <code>a</code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:
              <ol>
      <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
    <li>Wrap the text in an <code>a</code> element, as shown below:
      <a>Mozilla Manifesto</a></li>
    <li>Give the <code>a</code> element an href attribute, as shown below:
      <a href="">Mozilla Manifesto</a></li>
    <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a></li>
              </ol>
            </p>
